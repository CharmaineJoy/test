"Young People need good teachers, like Visible Angels" - St. John Baptist de La Salle

Everytime i hear the word "Angels", the first thing that comes in to my mind is "Invisibility" because when i was a child, they told me that we cannot see angels, that angels have wings and they guide us wherever we go. but now i grew up, i realized that everyone could be one's angel. i mean we can change bad people into a good one by being good a good teacher to him/her. a good teacher means that you are a great friend, someone to turn to and will always be there for you and will teach you things that cannot harm you or others. everyone needs a friend, like these Visible angels. so, let's thank God for the blessings he gave on us.
